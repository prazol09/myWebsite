            <p>I am a computer programer, web developer, and database designer. 
                I live in kathmandu city. I believe, our lives should be a little more comfortable. 
                Reducing minor responsibilities here and there might not seem like much but it adds up, 
                after a certain period of time, allowing clever programs to handle such 
                responsibilities will give us time to relax and take it easy. 
                And I am capabale of making things and simpler by writing those clever programs.
